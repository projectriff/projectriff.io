Using [riff v0.1](https://projectriff.io/blog/announcing-riff-0-1-0-on-Knative/), which builds on [Knative](https://github.com/knative/docs), the new open source project initiated by Google to which the riff team is contributing, Mark Fisher creates and invokes a riff function in this 60ish second overview.
