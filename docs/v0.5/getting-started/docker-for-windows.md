The following will help you get started running a riff function with Knative on Docker Community Edition for Windows.

## Install Docker

Kubernetes and the kubectl CLI are now included with [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/). Docker Desktop for Windows requires [Hyper-V](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v#enable-the-hyper-v-role-through-settings) on Windows 10 Pro.

### resize the VM

Once Docker is installed and running, open Settings by right-clicking the Docker tray icon and configure your VM with 4GB of memory and 4 CPUs in the Advanced settings tab. Click on Apply.

![configure Docker VM](/img/docker-vm-config-windows.png)

### allow sharing of the C: drive

In the Shared Drives settings, enable sharing for the C drive, and enter your Windows password when prompted. This will be used for persistent volume claims to provide cache storage during function builds.

### enable Kubernetes

Enable Kubernetes in the Kubernetes tab, click on Apply, and wait for the installation to complete and the cluster to start. If there is no Kubernetes tab, you may need to [switch to Linux containers](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#switch-between-windows-and-linux-containers) first.

![enable Kubernetes](/img/docker-kubernetes-windows.png)

Confirm that your kubectl context is pointing to "docker-desktop".

```powershell
kubectl config current-context
```

If you previously had a different cluster configured, switch your kubectl context to "docker-desktop" using a PowerShell or command window.

```powershell
kubectl config use-context docker-desktop
```

### monitor your cluster

At this point it is useful to monitor your Kubernetes cluster. If you have [git bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) installed, create a bash script called `watch`, with the following content.

```powershell
#!/bin/bash
ARGS="${@}"
clear;
while(true); do
  OUTPUT=`$ARGS`
  clear
  echo -e "${OUTPUT[@]}"
  sleep 1
done
```

Start by watching all namespaces to confirm that Kubernetes is running.

```powershell
watch kubectl get pod --all-namespaces
```

```
NAMESPACE     NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

```

## Install kapp

[kapp](https://get-kapp.io/) is a simple deployment tool for Kubernetes. The riff runtime and its dependencies are provided as standard Kubernetes yaml files, that can be installed with kapp.

Download a recent binary for your platform from [github](https://github.com/k14s/kapp/releases).
Move it into a directory on your path, and make it executable.
Complete kapp installation instructions can be found [here](https://k14s.io/#install-from-github-release)

Validate the installation.

```powershell
kapp version
```

```
Client Version: 0.17.0

Succeeded
```

## Install ytt

[ytt](https://get-ytt.io/) is a tool for templating yaml. It can be used to apply changes to the distributed Kubernetes yamls files used to install riff.

Download a recent binary for your platform from [github](https://github.com/k14s/ytt/releases).
Move it into a directory on your path, and make it executable.
Complete ytt installation instructions can be found [here](https://k14s.io/#install-from-github-release)

Validate the installation.

```powershell
ytt version
```

```
Version: 0.23.0
```

## Install a snapshot build of the riff CLI

A recent snapshot build of the riff [CLI for Windows](https://storage.cloud.google.com/projectriff/riff-cli/releases/v0.5.0-snapshot/riff-windows-amd64.zip) can be downloaded from our [GCS].

Alternatively, clone the [riff CLI repo](https://github.com/projectriff/cli/), and run `make build install`. This will require a recent [go build environment](https://golang.org/doc/install#install).

Check that the riff CLI version is 0.5.0-snapshot.

```powershell
riff --version
```

```
riff version 0.5.0-snapshot (443fc9125dd6d8eecd1f7e1a13fa93b88fd4f972)
```

## Install riff Using kapp

riff can be installed with optional runtimes. The riff build system is always installed, and is required by each runtime.

Create a namespace for kapp to store configuration:

```powershell
kubectl create ns apps
```

### install riff Build

To install riff build and it's dependencies:

```powershell
kapp deploy -n apps -a cert-manager -f https://storage.googleapis.com/projectriff/charts/uncharted/0.5.0-snapshot/cert-manager.yaml
```

```powershell
kapp deploy -n apps -a kpack -f https://storage.googleapis.com/projectriff/charts/uncharted/0.5.0-snapshot/kpack.yaml
```

```powershell
kapp deploy -n apps -a riff-builders -f https://storage.googleapis.com/projectriff/charts/uncharted/0.5.0-snapshot/riff-builders.yaml
```

```powershell
kapp deploy -n apps -a riff-build -f https://storage.googleapis.com/projectriff/charts/uncharted/0.5.0-snapshot/riff-build.yaml
```

### install riff Core Runtime

To optionally install riff Core Runtime:

```powershell
kapp deploy -n apps -a riff-core-runtime -f https://storage.googleapis.com/projectriff/charts/uncharted/0.5.0-snapshot/riff-core-runtime.yaml
```

### install riff Knative Runtime

To optionally install riff Knative Runtime and it's dependencies:

```powershell
# ytt is used to convert the ingress service to NodePort because Docker for Windows does not support `LoadBalancer` services.
ytt -f https://storage.googleapis.com/projectriff/charts/uncharted/0.5.0-snapshot/istio.yaml -f https://storage.googleapis.com/projectriff/charts/overlays/service-nodeport.yaml --file-mark istio.yaml:type=yaml-plain | kapp deploy -n apps -a istio -f - -y
```

```powershell
kapp deploy -n apps -a knative -f https://storage.googleapis.com/projectriff/charts/uncharted/0.5.0-snapshot/knative.yaml
```

```powershell
kapp deploy -n apps -a riff-knative-runtime -f https://storage.googleapis.com/projectriff/charts/uncharted/0.5.0-snapshot/riff-knative-runtime.yaml
```

### install riff Streaming Runtime

Install riff Streaming Runtime and it's dependencies:

```powershell
kapp deploy -n apps -a keda -f https://storage.googleapis.com/projectriff/charts/uncharted/0.5.0-snapshot/keda.yaml
```

```powershell
kapp deploy -n apps -a riff-streaming-runtime -f https://storage.googleapis.com/projectriff/charts/uncharted/0.5.0-snapshot/riff-streaming-runtime.yaml
```

> NOTE: After installing the Streaming Runtime, configure Kafka with a [KafkaProvider](/docs/v0.5/runtimes/streaming#kafkaprovider).

### verify riff installation

Resources may be missing if the corresponding runtime was not installed.

```powershell
riff doctor
```

```
NAMESPACE     STATUS
riff-system   ok

RESOURCE                              READ      WRITE

pods                                  allowed   n/a
pods/log                              allowed   n/a
applications.build.projectriff.io     allowed   allowed

processors.streaming.projectriff.io   allowed   allowed
streams.streaming.projectriff.io      allowed   allowed
adapters.knative.projectriff.io       allowed   allowed
deployers.knative.projectriff.io      allowed   allowed
```

### apply build credentials

Use the riff CLI to apply credentials to a container registry (if you plan on using a namespace other than `default` add the `--namespace` flag). Replace the ??? with your docker username.

```powershell
riff credential apply my-creds --set-default-image-prefix --docker-hub ???
```

You will be prompted to provide the password.

> On Windows, a known issue prevents the password prompt from working in git bash. Use the Windows PowerShell or Command terminal instead.

## Create a function from a GitHub repo

This riff command (formatted for PowerShell) will pull the source code for a function from a GitHub repo, build a container image based on the node function invoker, and push the resulting image to your dockerhub repo.

```powershell
riff function create square `
  --git-repo https://github.com/projectriff-samples/node-square  `
  --artifact square.js `
  --tail
```

After the function is created, you can get the built image by listing functions.

```powershell
riff function list
```

```
NAME     LATEST IMAGE                                                                                                ARTIFACT    HANDLER   INVOKER   STATUS   AGE
square   index.docker.io/$DOCKER_ID/square@sha256:ac089ca183368aa831597f94a2dbb462a157ccf7bbe0f3868294e15a24308f68   square.js   <empty>   <empty>   Ready    1m13s
```

> Due to differences between Windows and Linux file permissions, local builds are not supported on Windows. We suggest building from a git repository as a workaround.

## Create a Knative deployer

The [Knative Runtime](../runtimes/knative.md) is only available on clusters with Istio and Knative installed. Knative deployers run riff workloads using Knative resources which provide auto-scaling (including scale-to-zero) based on HTTP request traffic, and routing.

```powershell
riff knative deployer create knative-square --function-ref square --ingress-policy External --tail
```

After the deployer is created, you can see the hostname by listing deployers.

```powershell
riff knative deployer list
```

```
NAME             TYPE       REF      HOST                                 STATUS   AGE
knative-square   function   square   knative-square.default.example.com   Ready    28s
```

### invoke the function

Knative configures HTTP routes on the istio-ingressgateway. Requests are routed by hostname.

Look up the nodePort for the ingressgateway; you should see a port value like `30086`.

```powershell
$INGRESS_PORT = kubectl get svc istio-ingressgateway --namespace istio-system `
  --output 'jsonpath={.spec.ports[?(@.port==80)].nodePort}'

$INGRESS_PORT
```

Invoke the function by POSTing to the ingressgateway on the nodePort, passing hostname and content-type as headers.

```powershell
curl http://localhost:$INGRESS_PORT/ `
  -H 'Host: knative-square.default.example.com' `
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' `
  -d 7
```

```
49
```

The command above uses OSS `curl` which can be installed from an Admin PowerShell using `choco install curl` (assumes [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)).
Remove the built-in PowerShell `curl` alias with `Remove-item alias:curl`.

### create a Core deployer

The Core Runtime runs riff workloads by creating Kubernetes built-in [deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) and [service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#service-resource) resources.

```powershell
riff core deployer create k8s-square --function-ref square --tail
```

After the deployer is created, you can see the service name by listing deployers.

```powershell
riff core deployers list
```

```
NAME         TYPE       REF      URL                                           STATUS   AGE
k8s-square   function   square   http://k8s-square.default.svc.cluster.local   Ready    35s
```

### invoke the function

In a separate terminal, start port-forwarding to the ClusterIP service created by the deployer.

```powershell
kubectl port-forward service/k8s-square 8080:80
```

```
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 8080
Forwarding from [::1]:8080 -> 8080
```

Make a POST request to invoke the function using the port assigned above.

```powershell
curl http://localhost:8080/ `
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' `
-d 8
```

```
64
```

Note that unlike Knative, the Core runtime will not scale deployments down to zero.

## Delete the function and deployers

```powershell
riff knative deployer delete knative-square
riff core deployer delete k8s-square
riff function delete square
```

## Uninstalling and reinstalling

If you need to upgrade or reinstall riff, we recommend resetting the Kubernetes cluster first. To do this, click `Reset Kubernetes Cluster...` in the Reset tab in Docker Settings.
