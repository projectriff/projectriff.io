### TL;DR
1. install docker, kubectl, minikube, and helm
2. monitor your riff cluster with watch and kubectl
3. install kafka using a helm chart
4. install riff using a helm chart
5. create a sample function
6. publish an event to trigger the sample function
7. delete the sample function

### install docker
Installing [Docker Community Edition](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) is the easiest way get started with docker. Since minikube includes its own docker daemon, you actually only need the docker CLI to build function containers for riff. This means that if you want to, you can shut down the Docker (server) app, and turn off automatic startup of Docker on login.

### install kubectl
[Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) is the Kubernetes CLI. It is used to manage minikube as well as hosted Kubernetes clusters. If you already have the Google Cloud Platform SDK, use: `gcloud components install kubectl`.

### install minikube
[Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) is a Kubernetes environment which runs in a single virtual machine. See the [latest release](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases) for installation, and the [readme](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/master/README.md) for more detailed information.

### start your minikube cluster
```sh
minikube start --memory=4096
```
Once minikube is running you can open a browser-based dashboard with `minikube dashboard`.

### configure docker to build containers in minikube
This is only reqired once per terminal session. See [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/#reusing-the-docker-daemon) for more details.

```sh
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```

### monitor your minikube
At this point it is useful to monitor your minikube using a utility like `watch` to refresh the output of `kubectl get` in a separate terminal window every one or two seconds.
```
brew install watch
watch -n 1 kubectl get pods,deployments --all-namespaces
```

### install helm
[Helm](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm) is used to package and install resources for Kubernetes. Helm packages are called charts. After [installing](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm) the helm CLI, use `helm init` to install the helm server (aka "tiller") in minikube, and point helm to the riff-charts repo.
```sh
helm init
helm repo add projectriff https://riff-charts.storage.googleapis.com
helm repo update
```
Watch kubectl for tiller to start running.

### install kafka
Install kafka on the `riff-system` namespace, with the release name `transport`.

```sh
kubectl create namespace riff-system
helm install projectriff/kafka \
  --name transport \
  --namespace riff-system
```
Watch kubectl for kafka to start running. You may need to wait a minute for the container images to be pulled, and for zookeeper to start first.

### install riff
Install riff on the same `riff-system` namespace, with the release name `control`. For minikube you can turn off RBAC, and use a NodePort for the HTTP gateway.

```sh
helm install projectriff/riff \
  --name control \
  --namespace riff-system \
  --set rbac.create=false \
  --set httpGateway.service.type=NodePort
```
Watch the riff-system namespace with kubectl, and wait for the riff http-gateway, topic-controller, and function-controller to start running.

```
watch -n 1 kubectl get po,deploy --namespace riff-system
```

```

```

### install the current riff CLI tool

Starting with the 0.0.4 version we provide a CLI tool written in Go that makes it easy to create and deploy functions.
Install the CLI by following the instructions on the [riff release page](https://github.com/projectriff/riff/releases).

## new function using node.js
The steps below will create a JavaScript function from scratch. The same files are also available in the `square` [sample](https://github.com/projectriff/riff/blob/master/samples/node/square/) on GitHub.

### write the function source
Create `square.js` in an empty directory.
```js
module.exports = (x) => x ** 2
```

### create the function deployment
Run the following command from the same directory where the above function file is created:

```bash
riff create --name square --input numbers --filepath .
```
This command will initialize the function, creating a `Dockerfile` and YAML files `square-function.yaml` and `square-topics.yaml` 
defining the Kubernetes resources for the function and topics respectively. It will also build the docker image and apply the Kubernetes function and topics resources to the cluster.

### watch for functions and topics in the default namespace

```
watch -n 1 kubectl get functions,topics,pods,deployments
```

### trigger the function
```bash
riff publish --input numbers --data 10 --reply
```
If `10` is the input to the square function, the response should be `100`.
You can also abbreviate parameters as follows:

```bash
riff publish -i numbers -d 10 -r
```

### delete the function and topic

```bash
riff delete --name square --all
```
