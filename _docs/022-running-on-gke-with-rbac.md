These instructions describe getting started on GKE if you are using Kubernetes with [RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/).

### TL;DR
1. select a Project in the Google Cloud console, install gcloud and kubectl
2. create a GKE cluster with Kubernetes v1.8.x or v1.9.x  (defaults to RBAC with "Legacy Authorization" disabled)
3. configure credentials to target the GKE cluster from kubectl
4. remove the CPU request limit for containers in the new cluster
5. grant yourself cluster-admin permissions
6. install helm and start the helm server (tiller) with RBAC
7. install Kafka
8. install riff with RBAC

The remaining steps are the same as [getting started on GKE](../getting-started-on-gke/#new-function-using-nodejs).

### create a Google Cloud project
A project is required to consume any Google Cloud services, including GKE clusters. When you log into the [console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) you can select or create a project from the dropdown at the top.

### install gcloud
Follow the [quickstart instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts) to install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) which includes the `gcloud` CLI. You may need to add the `google-cloud-sdk/bin` directory to your path. Once installed, authorize and configure gcloud for your account.

```sh
gcloud init
```

### install kubectl
[Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) is the Kubernetes CLI. It is used to manage minikube as well as hosted Kubernetes clusters like GKE. If you don't already have kubectl on your machine, you can use gcloud to install it.

```sh
gcloud components install kubectl
```

### create a GKE cluster
Look for [Kubernetes Engine](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/) in the console, and create a new cluster. Select a Cluster Version of 1.8+ or later with "Legacy Authorization" disabled to enable RBAC. The minimum configuration for riff on GKE is single node cluster with 2 vCPUs and 7.5GB memory.


### configure credentials to target the GKE cluster
Once the cluster has been created, you will see a `Connect` button in the console. Run the first command `gcloud container clusters get-credentials ...` to fetch the credentials and add a new context for kubectl. Your kubectl context will be switched to the new cluster.

```sh
kubectl config current-context
```

### remove CPU request limit
Remove the GKE default request of 0.1 CPU's per container which limits how many containers your cluster is allowed to schedule (effectively 10 per vCPU).

```sh
kubectl delete limitrange limits
```

### grant yourself cluster-admin permissions
This looks up your account name (usually your email address) and then creates a new cluster role binding, to make you a cluster-admin.

```sh
export GCP_USER=$(gcloud config get-value account | head -n 1)
kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=$GCP_USER
```

If you encounter "Error from server (Forbidden)...", ask your GKE project admin to grant you `container.clusterRoleBindings.create` permissions.

Alternatively, lookup the admin password for the cluster in the console, and then issue the following command, entering the admin password when prompted.

```sh
read -rsp "password: " APW && echo && kubectl --username=admin --password="$APW" create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=$GCP_USER
```

### monitor resources in your kubernetes cluster
At this point it is useful to monitor your kubernetes cluster using a utility like `watch` to refresh the output of `kubectl get` in a separate terminal window every one or two seconds.
```
brew install watch
watch -n 1 kubectl get pods,deployments --all-namespaces
```

### install helm
[Helm](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm) is used to package and install resources for Kubernetes. Helm packages are called charts. After [installing](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm) the helm CLI, point helm to the riff-charts repo.
```
helm repo add projectriff https://riff-charts.storage.googleapis.com
helm repo update
```

### start the helm server (tiller) with RBAC
The Helm project describes the [Best Practices for Securing Helm and Tiller](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#best-practices-for-securing-helm-and-tiller) in their documentation. This can be fairly involved and for less critical development clusters it is easier to configure the Helm tiller server to run with cluster-admin privileges using a service account in the `kube-system` namespace.

The following commands come from the Helm getting started doc in the [riff repo](https://github.com/projectriff/riff/blob/master/Getting-Started.adoc#install-helm) on GitHub.

```sh
kubectl -n kube-system create serviceaccount tiller
kubectl create clusterrolebinding tiller --clusterrole cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:tiller
helm init --service-account=tiller
```
Watch kubectl for tiller to start running.

### install kafka
Install Kafka on the `riff-system` namespace, with the release name `transport`.

```sh
kubectl create namespace riff-system
helm install projectriff/kafka \
  --name transport \
  --namespace riff-system
```
Watch kubectl for kafka to start running. You may need to wait a minute for the container images to be pulled, and for zookeeper to start first.

### install riff with RBAC
Install the riff 0.0.4 helm chart on the `riff-system` namespace, with the release name `control`.

```sh
helm install projectriff/riff \
  --name control \
  --namespace riff-system
```

Watch the riff-system namespace with kubectl, and wait for the riff http-gateway, topic-controller, and function-controller to start running.

```
watch -n 1 kubectl get po,deploy --namespace riff-system
```

```

```

At this point you can continue creating your function as described in [getting started on GKE](../getting-started-on-gke/#new-function-using-nodejs) (without RBAC).

### to access the Kubernetes dashboard
Recent releases of the Kubernetes dashboard require a bearer token in order to login. The easiest way to do this, is to lookup the token associated with the `tiller` account created above and paste it into the login form.

```sh
kubectl -n kube-system describe secret $(kubectl -n kube-system get secret | grep tiller | awk '{print $1}')
```

For more details see the dashboard [wiki](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/wiki/Access-control#introduction) and [issue #2474](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/issues/2474).
