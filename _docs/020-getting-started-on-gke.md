The following will help you get started on GKE without [RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/).  
See [here](/docs/running-on-gke-with-rbac/) for instructions with RBAC.

### TL;DR
1. select a Project in the Google Cloud console, install gcloud and kubectl
2. create a GKE cluster
3. configure credentials to target the GKE cluster from kubectl
4. remove the CPU request limit for containers in the new cluster
5. install helm
6. install kafka and riff on the GKE cluster using helm charts
7. install Docker and create a Docker ID
8. build one of the sample functions
9. apply the function and topic resource definitions to Kubernetes
10. send an event to the topic to trigger the function

### create a Google Cloud project
A project is required to consume any Google Cloud services, including GKE clusters. When you log into the [console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) you can select or create a project from the dropdown at the top.

### install gcloud
Follow the [quickstart instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts) to install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) which includes the `gcloud` CLI. You may need to add the `google-cloud-sdk/bin` directory to your path. Once installed, `gcloud init` will open a browser to start an oauth flow and configure gcloud to use your project.

```
gcloud init
```

### install kubectl
[Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) is the Kubernetes CLI. It is used to manage minikube as well as hosted Kubernetes clusters like GKE. If you don't already have kubectl on your machine, you can use gcloud to install it.

```
gcloud components install kubectl
```

### create a GKE cluster
Look for [Kubernetes Engine](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/) in the console, and create a new cluster. The minimum configuration for riff on GKE is single node cluster with 2 vCPUs and 7.5GB memory. Using the default 1.7x version of Kubernetes without RBAC will simplify the configuration.

### configure credentials to target the GKE cluster
Once the cluster has been created, you will see a `Connect` button in the console. Run the first command `gcloud container clusters get-credentials ...` to fetch the credentials and add a new context for kubectl. Your kubectl context will be switched to the new cluster.

```
kubectl config current-context
```

### remove CPU request limit
Remove the GKE default request of 0.1 CPU's per container which limits how many containers your cluster is allowed to schedule (effectively 10 per vCPU).

```
kubectl delete limitrange limits
```

### monitor resources in your kubernetes cluster
At this point it is useful to monitor your kubernetes cluster using a utility like `watch` to refresh the output of `kubectl get` in a separate terminal window every one or two seconds.
```
brew install watch
watch -n 1 kubectl get pods,deployments --all-namespaces
```

### install helm
[Helm](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm) is used to package and install resources for Kubernetes. Helm packages are called charts. After [installing](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm) the helm CLI, use `helm init` to install the helm server (aka "tiller"), and point helm to the riff-charts repo.
```
helm init
helm repo add projectriff https://riff-charts.storage.googleapis.com
helm repo update
```
Watch kubectl for tiller to start running.

### install kafka
Install kafka on the `riff-system` namespace, with the release name `transport`.

```sh
kubectl create namespace riff-system
helm install projectriff/kafka \
  --name transport \
  --namespace riff-system
```
Watch kubectl for kafka to start running. You may need to wait a minute for the container images to be pulled, and for zookeeper to start first.

### install riff
Install riff on the same `riff-system` namespace, with the release name `demo`. In this case we are deploying without RBAC.
```sh
helm install projectriff/riff \
  --version 0.0.4 \
  --set rbac.create=false \
  --name demo \
  --namespace riff-system
```
Watch the riff-system namespace with kubectl, and wait for the riff http-gateway, topic-controller, and function-controller to start running.

```
watch -n 1 kubectl get po,deploy --namespace riff-system
```

```

```

## new function using node.js
The steps below will create a JavaScript function from scratch. The same files are also available in the `square` [sample](https://github.com/projectriff/riff/blob/master/samples/node/square/) on GitHub.

### write the function
Create `square.js` in an empty directory.

```js
module.exports = (x) => x ** 2
```

### install Docker and create a Docker ID
Installing [Docker Community Edition](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) is the easiest way get started with docker.
Visit https://hub.docker.com/ to create a new Docker ID. You will push your function container to a repo under this ID, so use your Docker ID credentals to login.

```
docker login
```

### Dockerfile
Create a new file called `Dockerfile` in the same directory.
This container will be built on the `node-function-invoker` base image.

```docker
FROM projectriff/node-function-invoker:0.0.4
ENV FUNCTION_URI /functions/function.js
ADD square.js ${FUNCTION_URI}
```

### Docker build
Use the docker CLI to build the function container image. Prefix the image name by replacing `<your-Docker-ID>` below with your own Docker ID. Note the `.` at the end of the `docker build...` command.

```sh
docker build -t <your-Docker-ID>/square:v0001 .
```

After performing the build push the image to your own Docker Hub repo.

```sh
docker push <your-Docker-ID>/square:v0001
```

### function and topic resource definitions
Create a single `square.yaml` file for both resource definitions.
Use the same image name and tag as the Docker build, replacing `<your-Docker-ID>` as before.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectriff.io/v1
kind: Topic
metadata:
  name: numbers
---

apiVersion: projectriff.io/v1
kind: Function
metadata:
  name: square
spec:
  protocol: http
  input: numbers
  container:
    image: <your-Docker-ID>/square:v0001
```

### watch for functions and topics
Use kubectl to watch the default namespace.

```sh
watch -n 1 kubectl get functions,topics,pods,deployments
```

### apply the yaml to kubernetes

```sh
kubectl apply -f square.yaml
```

### trigger the function
```sh
export GATEWAY=`kubectl get service -l component=http-gateway -n riff-system -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'`
export HEADER="Content-Type: text/plain"
curl $GATEWAY/requests/numbers -H "$HEADER" -w "\n" -d 10
```
If `10` is the input to the square function, the response should be `100`.
